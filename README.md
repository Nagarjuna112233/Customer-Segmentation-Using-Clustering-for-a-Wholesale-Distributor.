# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-for-a-Wholesale-Distributor.
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means and Hierarchical clustering, to segment a wholesale distributor's customers based on their annual spending across various product categories.

# Key Objectives:
- Targeted Promotions: Develop marketing strategies tailored to specific customer segments.

- Personalized Marketing: Customize marketing approaches to meet the unique needs of each customer group.

- High-Value Client Identification: Identify and prioritize high-value clients for strategic business initiatives.

- Inventory Optimization: Align inventory and distribution strategies with the purchasing behavior of different customer segments.

# Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling the dataset to ensure consistency and suitability for clustering.

Clustering Analysis: Applying K-Means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms to identify customer segments.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the clustering quality using metrics such as the Silhouette coefficient and the Elbow method.

Segmentation Profiling: Analyzing and interpreting the characteristics of each identified segment
